# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository! 🚀  
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution, from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.


## 🔗 Two-Part SQL Portfolio Project

This end-to-end SQL project is divided into two connected repositories, covering the complete journey from raw data ingestion to business analysis and reporting.

Part 1: SQL Data Warehouse

The first part focuses on building a modern data warehouse using the Medallion Architecture.

It includes:

* Loading raw CRM and ERP data into the Bronze Layer
* Cleaning and standardizing data in the Silver Layer
* Integrating multiple source systems
* Building fact and dimension tables in the Gold Layer
* Creating a business-ready star schema for analytics

Part 2: SQL Data Analysis

The second part uses the Gold Layer tables created in Project 1 to perform SQL-based business analysis.

It includes:

* Database and dimension exploration
* Data quality and relationship checks
* Sales, customer and product KPIs

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:
![Data Architecture](docs/data_architecture.png)

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

## 🚀 Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

#### Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

#### Specifications
- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

---

### BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)

#### Objective
Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:
- **Customer Behavior**
- **Product Performance**
- **Sales Trends**

These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making.

          Gold.dim_customers
          Gold.dim_products
          Gold.fact_sales
          
6. Open Project 2 in SSMS

          01. Database Exploration
          02. Dimensions Exploration
          03. Date and Time Exploration
          04. Measure Exploration
          05. Magnitude Analysis
          06. Ranking Analysis

          09. Performance Analysis
          10. Part-to-Whole Analysis
          11. Data Segmentation
          12. Create the Final Reports
          
Run:

          Customer_Report.sql
          Products_Report.sql

8. View the Results
   
          SELECT * FROM Gold.dim_customers;
          SELECT * FROM Gold.dim_products;
          SELECT * FROM Gold.fact_sales;
          SELECT * FROM Gold.report_customer;
          SELECT * FROM Gold.report_products;
